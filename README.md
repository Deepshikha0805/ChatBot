# ChatBot
This Python code implements a basic chatbot that responds to user inputs. Here's a shorter description:

The code analyzes user messages using regular expressions and predefined patterns to generate appropriate responses. It calculates the probability of matching recognized words in the user message and checks for required words if specified. If the probability meets the criteria, the chatbot returns a response.

The code provides a set of predefined responses for common greetings, farewells, and specific questions. It also includes longer responses for advice and inquiries about the chatbot's eating habits.

When executed, the chatbot prompts the user for input, processes the message, and returns a suitable response based on the highest probability match.

This code serves as a basic chatbot framework and can be expanded to incorporate more complex conversation patterns and tailored responses.
